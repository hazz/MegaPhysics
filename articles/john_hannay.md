====

Believed to be one of the few men in the world who actually understands physics. Was once told, in the 90s, that he needed to buy a computer; he has not seen the need to do so again since. Also thought to be one of the few men in the world who believes the inclusion of a handle in the original iMac makes it a portable computer.

### Strengths

Angles, and anything that involves whirling.

### Weaknesses

Technology and water, particularly in combination. Also believed to have difficulty with pendulums, though this is unconfirmed.
