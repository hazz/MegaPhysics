Quark
=====

These may be thought of as particles that make up other particles. They
are not known to exist individually, but rather as components of larger
particles, such as protons and neutrons.

## Flavours

The different types of quarks are called flavours, of which there are
six: up, down, top, bottom, strange and charm. These different types
have a number of properties, such as charge, as seen in the table below:

<table class="table table-hover table-condensed">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Quark</th>
      <th>Charge</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Up</td>
      <td>+ 2/3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top</td>
      <td>+ 2/3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Charm</td>
      <td>+ 2/3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Down</td>
      <td>- 1/3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bottom</td>
      <td>- 1/3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Strange</td>
      <td>- 1/3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

When quarks are put together to make a larger particle, these properties
combine. For example, to make a proton, which has an overall charge of
+1, two up quarks and one down quark are needed. To make a neutron,
which has an overall charge of 0, one up quark and two down quarks are
needed.
